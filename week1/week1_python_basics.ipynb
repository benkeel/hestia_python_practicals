    "**Python** is an extremely popular and versatile high-level programming language that was created by Guido Van Rossum in the 90s. It is a general-purpose language focusing on procedural programming *(on which we will focus)* and object-oriented programming. If these terms don't immediately make sense to you, don't worry at all because their definitions are not most important. If you are interested, though, have a read on Google.\n",

Along your journey of learning Python, then, try to find **parallels** in the two coding languages, and notice **equivalents** - i.e. how two functions, written differently in R and Python, do pretty much the same thing. Creating these links will both quickly boost your proficiency and confidence with working in Python.\n",
